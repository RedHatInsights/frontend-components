## Inventory hook

If you are using newer version of react, you can use hook that comes with this package to load inventory and reducers.

```JSX
import React, { Fragment } from 'react';
import { useStore } from 'react-redux';
import { useInventory } from '@redhat-cloud-services/frontend-components-utilities/files/useInventory';
import { getRegistry } from '@redhat-cloud-services/frontend-components-utilities/files/Registry';
import { entitiesReducer } from './redux/reducers/table';

const MyCmp = () => {
    const { InventoryTable } = useInventory({
        tableReducer: entitiesReducer,
        getRegistry
    });

    return (
        <Fragment>
            {InventoryTable && <InventoryTable />}
        </Fragment>
    );
}
```

#### `useInventory` accepts object with

* `getRegistry` - registry to be used to include newly created reducers from inventory
* `store` - react redux store, by default it is expected that `getRegistry` has method `getStore` if it does not have such method, please pass in your redux store to this hook.
* `tableReducer` - redux reducer function called to create table reducers, it will be called with all inventory action types. So you can change state based on some inv events.
* `detailReducer` - redux reducer function called to create detail reducers, it will be called with all inventory action types. So you can change state based on some inv events.

#### Example of reducer callback:

```JS
{
    tableReducer: (INVENTORY_ACTION_TYPES) => applyReducerHash(
        {
            [INVENTORY_ACTION_TYPES.LOAD_ENTITIES_PENDING]: (state) => ({
                ...state,
                inventoryLoading: true
            })
        },
        defaultState
    )
}
```

#### `useInventory` returns object
* InventoryDetail - detail components (`InventoryDetailHead`, `AppInfo` and `InventoryDetail`)
* InventoryTable - table component
* TagWithDialog - tags component
* newReducers - reducers to be registered in your store
* rawReducers - if you want to change how reducers are merged together here will be `mergeWithEntities` and `mergeWithDetail`

#### Custom register and Inv component

If you want to change the reducer that has been calculated or you want to assign component created from hook to your own state prop:

```JSX
import React, { useEffect, useState, Fragment } from 'react';
import { useStore } from 'react-redux';
import { useInventory } from '@redhat-cloud-services/frontend-components-utilities/files/useInventory';
import { getRegistry } from '@redhat-cloud-services/frontend-components-utilities/files/Registry';
import { entitiesReducer } from './redux/reducers/table';

const MyCmp = () => {
    const [ ConnectedInventory, setConnectedInventory ] = useState(null);
    const store = useStore();
    const { InventoryTable, newReducers } = useInventory({
        tableReducer: entitiesReducer,
        store
    });

    useEffect(() => {
        if (newReducers) {
            // do something with reducers or InventoryTable
            // don't forget to register newReducers in your redux!
            // for example `store.replaceReducers(newReducers);`
            setConnectedInventory(InventoryTable);
        }
    }, [newReducers])

    return (
        <Fragment>
            {ConnectedInventory && <ConnectedInventory />}
        </Fragment>
    );

}
```
