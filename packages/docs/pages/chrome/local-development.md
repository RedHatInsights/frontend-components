# Deugging Chrome Locally

There are some localStorage values for you to enable debuging information or enable some values that are in experimental state. If you want to enable them call `const iqe = insights.chrome.enable.iqe()` for instance to enable such service. This function will return callback to disable such feature so calling `iqe()` will remove such item from localStorage.
