# RedHat Cloud Services frontend components - inventory
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40redhat-cloud-services%2Ffrontend-components-inventory.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40redhat-cloud-services%2Ffrontend-components-inventory)

This package is hot loaded via [insights-chrome](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-chrome#readme) and exports new components for inventory table and detail. It also exports redux reducers and actions so usage is as simple as possible.

## !!!Deprecated package!!!

This package is deprecated. Please do not use it anymore! We are no longer supporting this package because we moved it to inventory application and exporting inventory components trough federated modules.

If you want to use inventory component, either use [Async inventory components](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/frontend-components/tree/master/packages/components/src/Inventory) or use directly [Async component](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/frontend-components/tree/master/packages/components/src/AsyncComponent)

1) Usage with `Async inventory component`
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { InventoryTable } from '@redhat-cloud-services/frontend-components/Inventory';

const Cmp = () => <InventoryTable />;

export default Cmp;
```

2) Usage with `Async component`
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';
import { useStore } from 'react-redux';
import AsyncComponent from '@redhat-cloud-services/frontend-components/AsyncComponent';

const Cmp = () => {
  const store = useStore();
  const history = useHistory();
  return (
    <AsyncComponent
      store={store}
      history={history}
      appName="inventory"
      module={`./InventoryTable`}
      fallback="Loading"
      ref={innerRef}
      {...props}
    />
  );
}

export default Cmp;
```
## Installation
