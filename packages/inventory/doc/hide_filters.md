# hideFilters

You can disable default filters by using a `hideFilters` prop.

```jsx
hideFilters: PropTypes.shape({
    tags: PropTypes.bool,
    name: PropTypes.bool,
    registeredWith: PropTypes.bool,
    stale: PropTypes.bool,
    all: PropTypes.bool,
})
```

By default all filters are set to `true`. You can override just part of it.

```jsx
<InventoryTable
    hideFilters={{ name: true }}
/>
```

This props is also passed to [custom fetch](./custom_fetch.md).

Hiding filters also removes their default values.

## tags

Similar to `showTags`, it hides the tags filter.

## name

Hides display name filter.

## registeredWith

Hides registered with filter.

## stale

Hides staleness filter.

## all

Hides all the filters. It has a lower priority than specific keys. You can hide all filter and then turn on specific ones. This makes sure that there will be no additional filters in the future.

**Example**

- name is shown
- all others are hidden

```jsx
<InventoryTable
    hideFilters={{ all: true, name: false }}
/>
```
